                    <p>As someone who is passionate about writing and using technology to make the world a better place, I developed a blog where I can post content about technology for social good. The blog features user authentication, as well as user ability to create a dated blog post, comment on other posts, delete and update posts.</p>

                    <p>I hope to expand with another blog that will have professional styling and content users will interact with.</p>
